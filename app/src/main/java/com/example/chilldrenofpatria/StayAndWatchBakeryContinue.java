                "“Uh, yeah,” you say. “There was a man walking around the edges of town when everyone was in the meeting. When he realized I saw him, he just kind of looked at me for a while, then he slipped behind the tannery.”\n" +
                "David glances at Hilda, then back at you. “Thank you,” he says. “Go get some food, then go to bed early. We have a lot to talk about.”\n" +
                "“Have a good night, Ben,” Hilda calls after you.\n" +
                "You do as they say and once you finish eating, you go to your room, not much larger than a closet, and lay on your bed. Every so often, their voices echo in the house as you drift to sleep.\n";
