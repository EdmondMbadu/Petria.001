Shivers pass through you as you press against the cold stone. The mist shimmers, morphing into a glimmering man. As it takes form you turn away from the blinding light. You struggle to look at his shining body. The light fades to reveal a massive painted man with dark braided hair and wings that swallow the room. \n" +
                "“I am beautiful power, blinding light, liberating guidance,” he says.\n" +
                "The sound of his voice shakes you. He flaps his wings and dissipates back into mist. You slide to the floor and look up at the ceiling. Before you can think, the mist begins again taking form. As it takes shape it flickers red. A goliath red humanoid forms before your eyes. Jagged scars cover its rough skin. Leather wings jut from its back scraping the walls. The floor shakes as its tail crashes down. \n" +
                "“I am terrible power, suffocating darkness, subjugating lies,” it says.\n" +
                "You look away from the twisted creature, and cover your ears. When you regain enough courage to open your eyes you find a winged lion before you. Awe inspired, you stand and look at it. You’ve never seen a lion before. It towers over you, unable to fully spread its wings.\n" +
                "“I am beyond your current understanding,” it says.\n" +
                "Its voice, though strong, is soft. Its eyes are white and its fur is umber. You reach out to touch it. The lion fragments, fading into mist once again. Your eyes glaze over for a few moments as you drift back to the wall. \n" +
                "“I’m sorry. I may have shocked you a bit too much.”\n" +
                "Noone is back, her curly, chestnut hair draped over her thin white dress. Air seems a little easier to breath. You stop leaning against the wall.\n" +
